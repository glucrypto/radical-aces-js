# Radical Aces: Java to JavaScript (Three.js) Conversion Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step approach to convert Radical Aces from a Java application to a modern JavaScript game using Three.js. We'll break this down into manageable phases with clear milestones to review progress.

The Java codebase is located in the `java` repository, besure to check that when making any changes as the reference.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Analysis

10. **Implement camera system** ✅ **(COMPLETED)**
    - [x] Create follow camera for player craft
    - [x] Add camera controls and constraints
    - [x] Implement different view modes if present in original
    - [x] Add camera effects (shake, zoom, etc.)

## Phase 5: Player Controls & Interactions

11. **Implement player controls** ✅ **(COMPLETED)**

    - [x] Map keyboard/mouse/touch inputs to actions
    - [x] Recreate flight physics and handling
    - [x] Add controller support
    - [x] Implement customizable controls

12. **Create player craft** ✅ **(COMPLETED)**
    - [x] Model the player aircraft in Three.js
    - [x] Implement animations and effects
    - [x] Add collision detection
    - [x] Create damage system

## Phase 6: Game Mechanics

13. **Implement enemy AI**

    - [ ] Convert AI behavior from Java
    - [ ] Create path finding and targeting systems
    - [ ] Implement difficulty scaling
    - [ ] Add enemy types and variations

14. **Add weapons systems**

    - [ ] Implement projectile physics
    - [ ] Create weapon effects and animations
    - [ ] Add impact detection and damage
    - [ ] Implement weapon upgrades and variations

15. **Create mission/objective system**
    - [ ] Define mission parameters and goals
    - [ ] Create mission tracking and progress
    - [ ] Implement rewards and advancement
    - [ ] Add mission briefing and debriefing

## Phase 7: Polish & Optimization

16. **Add sound and music**

    - [ ] Implement 3D spatial audio
    - [ ] Convert original sound effects
