# Radical Aces: Java to JavaScript (Three.js) Conversion Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step approach to convert Radical Aces from a Java application to a modern JavaScript game using Three.js. We'll break this down into manageable phases with clear milestones to review progress.
